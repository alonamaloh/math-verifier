# Build and file layout

How to build the library and how `library/` is organised.

*(Part of the project conventions; see `CLAUDE.md` for the index.)*

## Build

`make -j 16 library` from the project root. The dep graph is parallel;
warm rebuilds are sub-second. Always use `-j 16` (don't use bare `make`).

## File organization

```
library/
  axioms.math          -- foundational axioms (propext, function ext, etc.)
  Logic/               -- Equality, Quotient machinery, exists, etc.
  Natural/             -- Naturals, all the way to bezout, padic_valuation
  Integer/             -- Integers as Natural × Natural quotient
  Rational/            -- Rationals as (Integer, Natural) quotient
  Real/                -- Reals as Cauchy quotient of Rationals
  PAdic/               -- p-adics as p-adic-Cauchy quotient of Rationals
  Algebra/             -- IsMonoid, IsGroup, IsRing, IsCommutativeRing
  Test/                -- small test files for features (not math content)
```

Each module's files are layered (basics → operations → laws →
instances). Imports flow up; you can't import a layer above you.
