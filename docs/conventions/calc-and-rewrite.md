# Relation chains, let, and rewrite

Relation chains (informally "calc") with mixed relations, `let` abbreviations (ζ), preferring a chain over nested transitivity, `<chain> as NAME`, `rewrite`, diff-inferred congruence, and rewrite-under-binder.

*(Part of the project conventions; see `CLAUDE.md` for the index.)*

## Relation chains with mixed relations

A relation chain supports all five relations as step separators: `=`,
`≤`, `<`, `≥`, `>`. The chain's result picks the strongest relation
across its steps (any `<`/`>` makes it strict; otherwise `≤`/`≥` if
present; else `=`). Mixing forward (`<`/`≤`) with backward (`>`/`≥`)
is rejected — `=` is allowed in either direction. The chain is written
bare — at statement position, as a `:=`/arm body, or inside `{ … }` in
argument positions; the old `calc` anchor keyword is retired (A1
Phase 3).

```math
Rational.absolute_value(s(m) * (t(m) - t(n)))
   = Rational.absolute_value(s(m))
       * Rational.absolute_value(t(m) - t(n))   by abs_first_eq
   ≤ (successor(K_s) : Rational)
       * Rational.absolute_value(t(m) - t(n))   by first_factor_bound
   ≤ (successor(K_s) : Rational) * delta_t     by first_factor_bound_2
   ≤ Rational.halve(Rational.halve(epsilon))   by succ_K_s_delta_t_bound
```

The carrier-specific transitivity lemmas (`<T>.LessOrEqual.transitive`,
`<T>.LessThan.transitive_left/right`, `<T>.LessThan.weaken`,
`<T>.LessOrEqual.reflexive`) are looked up via the same operator
registry that drives binary `≤`/`<`. `=` steps get upgraded to `≤`
on the fly whenever the chain isn't all-`=`. `≥`/`>` work as
expression-level operators too: `a ≥ b` desugars to `b ≤ a` against
the existing `≤` registration.

Step proofs are parsed at the parseAdditive level — `=`/`≤`/`<`/`≥`/`>`
are reserved as separators, so step proofs containing those operators
must be parenthesised.

A by-less `=` step now runs the **full** auto-prover (not just the
reflexivity / diff / AC battery): if the cheap battery fails it falls back
to the same `autoProveClaim` an equality stated fact uses — context-fact
match, the equality bridge, and the symmetry flip (so `0 = b` closes from
a `b = 0` fact). A chain `=` step and an equality stated fact are one prover.

## Relation chains over preorders (`∣`, `⊆`, `≈`, …)

A relation chain also chains any transitive relation, not just the order
ones. A step separated by `∣` (divides), `⊆` (subset), or `≈`
(equinumerous) routes the whole chain to a generic-preorder fold that
uses the carrier's relation and its transitivity lemma (`<R>.transitive`
or `<R>_transitive`), absorbing interleaved `=` steps by transport:

```math
p
   ∣ 0                 -- p divides 0   (auto: divides_zero)
   = b                 -- 0 = b         (auto: the b = 0 fact, flipped)
```

proves `p ∣ b`, and `a = b ∣ c = d` proves `a ∣ d`. A single chain
uses one non-`=` relation. The carrier may even be `Type(0)` itself — `≈`
(`Equinumerous`, registered `operator (≈) on (_, _)`) chains types:
`X ≈ Y ≈ NaturalsBelow(n)` (see `Set/finite.math`). Reusing one of the
existing relation symbols (`∣`/`⊆`/`≈`) needs only its operator + a
`<R>.transitive` lemma in scope; a brand-new symbol also needs a lexer/parser
token (the relation separators are a fixed set).

### `let` for local abbreviations — the auto-prover sees through

`let X : T := V;` introduces a local abbreviation. The kernel
ζ-reduces references to `X` back to `V` whenever the auto-prover or
`isDefinitionallyEqual` need it, and the auto-prover's structural
matchers (lemma-index lookup, chain-step path-walk) ζ-unfold `X` to
`V` on match attempts. Both directions are wired:

- **Equality checks**: `isDefinitionallyEqual` carries the let-value on
  the kernel `ContextEntry`; FreeVariables for let-binders δ-reduce to
  their values during comparison. So `X = V by … as foo` works
  even when `foo`'s proof has the unfolded type.
- **Structural matching**: the auto-prover (in `autoProveCalcStep`)
  ζ-unfolds let-binders in the chain endpoints before running its
  pipeline, so library lemmas about `V` apply to goals stated in
  terms of `X`.

Use this for proofs where one long expression appears many times and
its structure is irrelevant to the surrounding argument. The
canonical example is `Rational.padic_absolute_value_at_representative(p, RationalRepresentative.make(nx, dx))` — abbreviating it to `absXAtRep`
shortens proofs dramatically without losing any kernel guarantees:

```math
let absXAtRep : Rational :=
    Rational.padic_absolute_value_at_representative(
        p, RationalRepresentative.make(nx, dx));
let absYAtRep : Rational :=
    Rational.padic_absolute_value_at_representative(
        p, RationalRepresentative.make(ny, dy));
-- … use absXAtRep, absYAtRep freely in relation chains …
```

The library-wide convention is still "spell out the long name once,
abbreviate when it appears 3+ times in the surrounding proof."

### Prefer a relation chain to `Equality.transitivity`

Nested `Equality.transitivity(A, transitivity(B, C))` — common in older
code — encodes a chain in a right-associated binary tree. A reader has
to mentally flatten the tree to see the actual chain. Rewriting as a
relation chain surfaces the intermediate forms as the math (a bare `by`
hint is a single expression, so a multi-step chain used there needs the
`{ … }` argument-position form):

```math
-- Hard to read (5 lines of nesting):
by Equality.transitivity(
       Equality.symmetry(lemmaA),
       Equality.transitivity(
           congruenceOf(f, hyp),
           lemmaB))

-- Reads as the math (4-link chain):
by {
      lhs
      = midpoint1   by Equality.symmetry(lemmaA)
      = midpoint2   by congruenceOf(f, hyp)
      = rhs         by lemmaB
    }
```

Bonus: under `CHECK_REDUNDANT_BY=1` (default), the auto-prover will
often close several of the `by` annotations on its own — local
hypotheses match via the in-scope hypothesis lookup, and library lemmas
match via the lemma index. The naturalProduct stated fact in
`PAdic/absolute_value.math` went from 5-deep transitivity to a 4-link
chain with ZERO `by` clauses this way.

Sibling diagnostic: pass `--check-redundant-calc-steps` to the
verifier (off by default — the per-pair auto-prover dispatch is
expensive on long chains) to also warn when an intermediate chain
TERM (not just a `by` annotation) is redundant — i.e., the
auto-prover can close the combined step from the previous endpoint
directly to the next-next endpoint. The warning cites the line of
the redundant intermediate so you know which `= midpoint` to
delete. Useful for trimming over-written chain proofs after the
auto-prover gains a new rule.

Two-step transitivity (`Equality.transitivity(stepA, stepB)`) is
borderline — a 3-link chain is the same length. Use whichever reads
more clearly; a chain usually wins because the intermediate form is named.

### The bare chain statement forms — `<chain> as NAME;` and bare `<chain>;`

A relation chain at statement position (inside a `{ … }` block,
terminated by `;`) binds its result into local scope, no naming
ceremony required (the old `calc` anchor keyword is retired — A1
Phase 3):

```math
-- Named binding — for downstream references:
(aInt * yPrime - qInt * bInt * yPrime)
   = (aInt - qInt * bInt) * yPrime
   = rInt * yPrime                                  as factoredEqualsRYPrime;

-- Anonymous binding — auto-prover still finds it by type-match:
a = b
     = c;
-- Later:
a = c        -- this step auto-closes via the binding above
     = d
```

Both forms bind `first <strongest-relation> last` (from the chain's
endpoints) into scope; the anonymous form synthesises a name like
`_calc_<line>_<col>`. Either way the binding is in scope for the rest of
the block, so the auto-prover's local-hypothesis matcher picks it up.

**Never hand-write `T by (chain)` to name a chain's result.** It restates
exactly what the chain already concludes — the bare `<chain>;` (or
`<chain> as NAME;`) *is* that stated fact, without the ceremony. This is
a hard style rule.

Mixed-relation chains work at statement position too: the binding gets
the chain's strongest relation. `a ≤ b = c as h;` binds `h : a ≤ c`;
the bare `a ≤ b = c;` binds it anonymously. (There is no "all-`=`
only" restriction — that earlier claim was wrong. A named-typed `by`
wrapper around a chain is never needed.)

Restriction:
- The `as NAME` postfix lives at the END of the chain, after the last
  step's optional `by`. Parses cleanly: `… = rhs by lemma as foo;`.

Math-reading rationale: a textbook proof reads "by calculation: A = B
= C; call this (∗); now…". The `as` form matches that phrasing
exactly. The anonymous form matches "by a calculation: A = B = C; now
…" where the auxiliary fact is used implicitly.

Lint: if you write `<chain> as NAME;` and NAME is never *textually*
referenced in the rest of the block, the elaborator warns "drop the
`as NAME` to use the anonymous form" (downstream chain steps consume
the equation by type-match either way, so the name is dead weight).
Pick `as NAME` only when a later step or stated fact spells the name out.

## Transport across an equation (`rewrite` is retired)

The `rewrite(…)` form is **retired** (owner call: transport plumbing in
a function-call costume — a CIC leak with a keyword). Every use has a
bare spelling:

- **On a chain step**: cite the equation directly — `by L` for
  `L : a = b`. The diff-inferred congruence finds the unique differing
  slot (symmetric uses included: no `Equality.symmetry` wrapper).
  Multi-occurrence motives fall back to `congruenceOf((z) ↦ …, L)`.
- **In statement position** (the old `rewrite(eq, term)`): state the
  equation (bare, or `as NAME` if referenced), state what the
  transported-from fact proves (`P(a) by <reason>;` or bare), then
  state the transported proposition itself — `P(b);` — and the
  context-equality bridge carries it across the in-scope equation.
  Where the fact must feed an argument position (e.g. inside
  `absurd(…)`, whose argument is type-inferring — brace blocks don't
  elaborate there), name the transported statement (`P(b) by
  substituting eq as h;`) and pass the name.
- **Order relations** (and any same-head proposition — `divides`,
  congruences, …): the bare statement closes too. The prover diffs the
  goal against a same-head in-scope fact position by position and
  carries the differing spots across an in-scope equation (or a plain
  reduction), so `2 ≤ p` plus `p = 1` yields the bare statement
  `2 ≤ 1;`. Reach for `P by substituting eq;` only when several
  equations could bridge the diff and the choice needs recording.

The old spelling fails with a migration error pointing at these forms.

## `by lemma` in a chain step — diff-inferred congruence

In a chain `=` step, if the `by` proof has type `Equality(T, a, b)` and
the step's two endpoints differ in a unique single-position slot at
exactly `(a, b)`, the elaborator auto-wraps with `Equality.congruence`.
The user just supplies the equation; the elaborator finds the slot.

```math
-- Used to require an explicit motive lambda:
Natural.power(Natural.padic_valuation(p, (1 + dy + dx*(1+dy))), p)
   = Natural.power(Natural.padic_valuation(p, (1+dx))
                       + Natural.padic_valuation(p, (1+dy)), p)
       by congruenceOf(
              (m : Natural) ↦ Natural.power(m, p),
              Natural.padic_valuation_multiplicative(
                  p, (1+dx), (1+dy), primality, succDxPos, succDyPos))

-- Now: the elaborator infers `λm. Natural.power(m, p)` from the diff.
Natural.power(Natural.padic_valuation(p, (1 + dy + dx*(1+dy))), p)
   = Natural.power(Natural.padic_valuation(p, (1+dx))
                       + Natural.padic_valuation(p, (1+dy)), p)
       by Natural.padic_valuation_multiplicative(
              p, (1+dx), (1+dy), primality, succDxPos, succDyPos)
```

How it works: the elaborator's `tryDiffApplyUserProof` walks the step's
`(previous, next)` in lockstep through `Application` nodes. At each
level, it tests whether the current `(subLeft, subRight)` matches the
proof's `(a, b)` modulo `isDefinitionallyEqual` (forward) or `(b, a)`
(symmetric — wraps in `Equality.symmetry`). On match, it wraps from
the innermost level outward with `Equality.congruence` calls,
reconstructing the path with the saved sibling subexpressions.

Limits:
- Single-position diff only. Multi-position diffs (the diff appears in
  two independent slots) fall through. Use explicit
  `congruenceOf(λm. …, eq)` or split into multiple chain steps.
- The user's proof has to elaborate without the step's expected type
  as a guide. Lemma calls with all arguments supplied are fine;
  underspecified lemma calls that needed the expected type to
  disambiguate won't reach the fallback.
- The match uses kernel `isDefinitionallyEqual`, so it sees through
  β/ζ/ι reductions — diff inference catches cases like
  `v_p((1+dx)*(1+dy))` (the lemma's LHS) vs `v_p(1+dy+dx*(1+dy))`
  (the step's slot) where multiplication reduces structurally.
- **Subtraction must surface the same way on both sides.** `a - b`
  (`subtract(a, b)`) and `a + -b` (`add(a, -b)`) print alike and are
  ring-equal, but the structural diff treats them as DISTINCT heads — so a
  lemma stated with `+ -` won't bridge a step written with `-` (or vice
  versa), and the rejection looks inexplicable because both relations print
  identically. The elaborator now hints at this ("this step involves
  subtraction …"). Fix: write both endpoints the same way, or close the step
  with `ring` (or a `by substituting` bridge).

## Rewrite under a binder — `by ((x) ↦ …)` in a chain step

When a chain `=` step's endpoints are the **same function `F` applied to
argument lists that differ in exactly one position — a binder body
`λx. f` vs `λx. g`** — the step is a congruence under that binder: it
holds as soon as `f(x) = g(x)` pointwise. Write the per-index proof
directly as the `by` step; the elaborator reads `f`/`g` and every shared
argument off the endpoints and discharges the step with the registered
congruence lemma. The canonical case is rewriting the summand of a
`Polynomial.Sum`:

```math
-- Verbose: respell BOTH summands + the Sum.extensional wrapper.
= Polynomial.Sum(r, (i) ↦ coefficient(p, i) * (coefficient(q, k−i) + coefficient(s, k−i)), k)
      by Polynomial.Sum.extensional(r,
             (i) ↦ (coefficient(p, i) * coefficient(q, k−i)) + (coefficient(p, i) * coefficient(s, k−i)),
             (i) ↦ coefficient(p, i) * (coefficient(q, k−i) + coefficient(s, k−i)),
             (i) ↦ Ring.distributivity_left(r, coefficient(p, i), coefficient(q, k−i), coefficient(s, k−i)),
             k)

-- Idiomatic: just the per-index proof. f, g, r, k are read off the
-- endpoints. Note the PARENS around the lambda (see below).
= Polynomial.Sum(r, (i) ↦ coefficient(p, i) * (coefficient(q, k−i) + coefficient(s, k−i)), k)
      by ((i : Natural) ↦
             Ring.distributivity_left(r, coefficient(p, i), coefficient(q, k−i), coefficient(s, k−i)))
```

**Registering a congruence lemma.** The mechanism is driven by a
registry, not a naming convention. Register the lemma for the function
head once, next to where it's defined:

```math
congruence_under_binder Polynomial.Sum := Polynomial.Sum.extensional
```

A `congruence_under_binder <F> := <L>` makes `L` available to discharge
under-binder steps on `F`. It is generic over `F` and over `L`'s argument
order: the elaborator applies `L` to the shared prefix + `f` + `g`, then
fills its remaining binders by walking them — the author's lambda goes to
the unique **pointwise-equality** binder (a `Pi` chain ending in `=`,
wherever it sits), every other binder from the next shared suffix argument
of `F`. So a range-restricted variant with a different layout works from
the same surface — register it too and the elaborator tries each in turn:

```math
congruence_under_binder Polynomial.Sum := Polynomial.Sum.extensional_range
-- now `by ((i) (smaller : i ≤ k) ↦ …)` closes a Sum step from
-- the range-restricted pointwise proof (Sum.extensional is tried first,
-- fails on the 2-binder lambda, then Sum.extensional_range matches).
```

How it fires: gated to a chain `=` step whose endpoints are a
single-binder-diff application of a head with a registered lemma AND
whose `by` proof is syntactically a lambda — so an ordinary lemma proof
of a `Sum = Sum` step (e.g. `by Sum.add(…)`) takes the normal path
untouched. The assembled proof is type-checked before use, so a wrong
guess never shadows a real step.

Gotchas / limits:
- **Parens are required:** `by ((x) ↦ …)`. A bare
  `by (x) ↦ …` parses wrong — the lambda body is greedy and
  eats the next chain step. Keep the parens.
- **One binder argument per step.** The endpoints must differ in exactly
  one position. Chained rewrites under the same Σ are separate steps.
- The lambda's binder count selects the variant (1 binder →
  `extensional`, 2 → `extensional_range`), since elaboration against the
  wrong lemma's pointwise type fails and falls through.

### `let` and ζ — current status

The 2026-era kernel does ζ-unfold let-binders in
`isDefinitionallyEqual` (the auto-prover, the rewrite matcher, and
the conditional's motive walker all see through them, per the section above on
let-for-local-abbreviations). The old advice "don't use `let` for
value abbreviations" — driven by a kernel that didn't ζ-track
let-binders through `congruenceOf`'s motive checks — no longer
applies.

Use `let` freely for value abbreviations. `ring` also ζ-unfolds the
goal up front (2026-06-12), so a let-bound ring constant is seen
structurally rather than as an opaque atom — the canonical use is

```math
let zero : ComplexNumber :=
    RingModulo.zero(Real.polynomial_commutative_ring, Complex.definingPolynomial);
let one : ComplexNumber :=
    RingModulo.one(Real.polynomial_commutative_ring, Complex.definingPolynomial);
ComplexNumber.partialSum((k : Natural) ↦ c * s(k), 0)
   = zero
   = c * zero    by ring
```

instead of spelling the full `RingModulo.zero(…, …)` wall at every
site. This is scoped to `ring` only — `field` and `linear_combination`
cancel the goal against cited HYPOTHESES whose types keep the let
spelling, so ζ-unfolding only the goal there desynchronises the atoms
(use the let-free spelling, or cite a let-typed stated fact, in those).

Two caveats remain:

- **Implicit-argument inference** may use the ζ-unfolded form rather
  than the let-bound name. For example, `Logic.Decidable.yes(midIsUpper)`
  inside `Real.bisectionStepWithDec(subset, intervals, _)` infers its
  implicit `P` from the third arg's signature (the unfolded form), not
  from `midIsUpper`'s declared type (the let-bound `midReal`). Two
  kernel-equal-but-not-structurally-equal terms result — fine for the
  kernel, but it matters if the surface tactic does literal subterm
  matching. The conditional's elaborator ζ-unfolds the target up front; other
  paths may need explicit ζ-unfold or binding a stated fact to align shapes.

- **Function-valued `let`s are not β-reduced after ζ.** `let f := (k) ↦
  g(k);` makes `f(i)` unfold to `(λk. g k) i`, NOT to `g(i)` — so `ring`
  and `by`-citation matching treat `f(i)` and `g(i)` as distinct
  atoms (the unfold substitutes the value but stops short of β). Either
  do the algebra in the `g(i)` form and let a by-less `=` step fold to
  `f(i)` (the full defeq path *does* β-reduce), or pass explicit
  arguments through the let (`by lemma(g(i))`, not an argument-free
  citation).
