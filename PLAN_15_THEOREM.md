## How to use this sheet

- Each item has an **ID** (e.g. `S0.D2`), a **status box**, an **effort tag**, and an
  **owes** field listing the IDs it depends on. Work bottom-up along the `owes` graph.
- **Status:** `[ ]` TODO · `[~]` WIP · `[B]` BLOCKED (note the blocker) · `[x]` DONE.
- **Effort:** `S` ≈ ≤2 days · `M` ≈ ~1 week · `L` ≈ 2–4 weeks · `XL` ≈ 1 month+.
- **★** marks the load-bearing theorems — the ones the rest of the stage leans on.
- "Library: …" notes which *existing* pieces of `library/` a stage builds on.

**Stage roll-up (skilled person-time; AI assistance compresses wall-clock more than the hard-reasoning stages):**

> **Gap assessment 2026-07-18:** the linear-algebra build (PLAN_LINEAR_ALGEBRA,
> rank–nullity + det(AB)) and the Cayley–Hamilton arc (PLAN_CAYLEY_HAMILTON,
> C1–C6) landed most of Stage 0 since this sheet was written — determinant,
> permutation sign, multiplicativity, Laplace expansion, and the adjugate all
> exist over an abstract `CommutativeRing`. **Stage 0's dominant risk
> ("determinant + permutation sign from scratch") is retired.** Remaining
> Stage 0 gaps: transpose (S0.M3, and with it det Aᵀ), the unimodular group
> (S0.D7), the Gram block (S0.G1–G3, not needed before Stage 2), the abstract
> bilinear pairing (S0.V2), and the field-invertibility/Cramer half of S0.D6.
> Stage 1 is untouched but its Stage-0 inputs are now nearly all on the shelf.
> Item-level status boxes below updated with file pointers.

| Stage | Theme | Effort | Dominant risk |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 0 | Linear algebra over ℤ/ℚ | ~4–6 wk | determinant + permutation sign from scratch |
| 1 | Quadratic forms & lattices | ~2–4 wk | isometry-invariance plumbing |
| 2 | Reduction & finiteness | ~3–6 wk | dedup-up-to-isometry to get exact counts |
| 3 | Escalation machinery | ~4–8 wk | machine-generating + deduping the ~207 rank-4 list |
| 4·P | p-adic foundations: re-introduce ℚ_p + carve ℤ_p toolkit | ~3–5 wk | dyadic (p=2) square classes |
| 4·L | local form theory: Hilbert symbol, Hasse invariant | ~3–5 wk | local representation bookkeeping |
| 4·G | genus / ℤ_p-lattices + three-squares (**gated**) | ~2–4 mo | dyadic Jordan theory; pay only if regularity is forced |
| 5 | Assembly & finite computation | ~3–8 wk | in-kernel performance of bounded checks |

*Stage 4 splits: **4·P** and **4·L** you build regardless (cheap, reusable); **4·G** is route-dependent — see the fork at the head of Stage 4 and defer it until `S3.E5` is in hand.*

**Conditional milestone (≈⅓ cost):** complete Stages 0–3 and 5 with every `S4.*`
admitted as an explicit axiom. That yields a kernel-checked *"Fifteen Theorem,
conditional on this finite table of ternary representation facts,"* and isolates
exactly which deep lemmas remain. Strongly recommended as the first publishable target.

- `S0.M2` `[x]` (M) Product associativity & distributivity; identity matrix `I`; `I·A = A`. — owes: S0.M1 · **DONE:** `Algebra/matrix_ring.math` + the `Matrix.ring` bundle (Cayley–Hamilton C5).
- `S0.M3` `[x]` (S) Transpose; `(AB)ᵀ = BᵀAᵀ`, `(Aᵀ)ᵀ = A`. — owes: S0.M1 · **DONE 2026-07-18:** `Algebra/matrix_transpose.math` — postfix `ᵀ` (new lexer token, wired like `⁻¹`; postfix results accept call arguments, so `Aᵀ(j, i)` reads naturally), `transpose_entry`, `transpose_transpose`, `transpose_add`/`_scale`, `Iᵀ = I`, `(A·B)ᵀ = Bᵀ·Aᵀ`.

**Permutations & sign (prerequisite for the Leibniz determinant)**
- `S0.P1` `[x]` (M) ★ Permutations of `Fin n`: group structure (compose, inverse, id). — owes: — · **DONE:** `Algebra/finite_permutation.math` (compose/inverse/identity + laws, swaps, extend).
- `S0.P2` `[x]` (L) ★ Sign of a permutation; well-defined parity; `sign` is a homomorphism (`sign(στ) = sign σ · sign τ`). — owes: S0.P1 · **DONE:** `Algebra/permutation_sign.math` (`Permutation.sign_compose`, `sign_is_unit`) + `permutation_transposition_sign.math` (`sign_swap`).

- `S0.D2` `[x]` (S) `det I = 1`; `det Aᵀ = det A`. — owes: S0.D1, S0.M3 · **DONE 2026-07-18.** `Algebra/determinant_transpose.math` (entry-product reindex along σ + `sign_inverse` + summing over the inversion rearrangement; new general lemmas `Permutation.inverse_inverse`, `Permutation.sign_inverse`, `inverse_map_permutes_allPermutations`) and `Algebra/determinant_identity.math` (`det I = 1` by delta-collapse to the identity term; new aggregation lemmas `productOver_one_function`, `productOver_zero_on_member`; general `Permutation.moved_index_of_not_identity`).
- `S0.D3` `[x]` (M) Multilinear & alternating in rows/columns; row swap flips sign; repeated row ⇒ `det = 0`. — owes: S0.D1 · **DONE (rows):** `Algebra/determinant_row_permutation.math` + `alternating_collapse.math` + `adjugate.math` (`determinant_updateRow_*`, repeated row). Column versions follow from `det Aᵀ` once S0.M3 lands.
- `S0.D4` `[x]` (L) ★ Multiplicativity: `det(AB) = det A · det B`. — owes: S0.D1, S0.D3 · **DONE:** `Algebra/determinant_multiplicative.math` (`Matrix.determinant_multiply`).

- `S0.D6` `[~]` (M) Adjugate; `A·adj(A) = det(A)·I`; over a field `A` invertible ⇔ `det A ≠ 0`; Cramer's rule. — owes: S0.D4, S0.D5 · **Adjugate + `Matrix.multiply_adjugate` DONE** (`Algebra/adjugate.math`); the field invertibility ⇔ `det ≠ 0` equivalence and Cramer remain.
- `S0.D7` `[x]` (M) Unimodular group `GLₙ(ℤ)`: integer `U` invertible over ℤ ⇔ `det U = ±1`. — owes: S0.D4, S0.D6 · **DONE 2026-07-18:** `Algebra/matrix_inverse.math` (two-sided `Matrix.IsInvertible`, adjugate right inverse, `invertible_of_unit_determinant` with the U = U·(V·W) = W bootstrap, `determinant_unit_of_right_inverse`) + `Algebra/unimodular.math` (both directions over `Integer.commutative_ring_bundle`) + `Integer/units.math` (`Integer.multiply_one_implies_unit`: the units of ℤ are ±1, via |x|·|y| = 1 at ℕ). New matrix-ring laws: `scale_scale`, `one_scale`.

**Gram machinery (the bridge to forms)**
- `S0.G1` `[ ]` (S) Gram matrix `G = MᵀM` is symmetric; `xᵀGx = ‖Mx‖²`. — owes: S0.M3
- `S0.G2` `[ ]` (M) Cauchy–Binet `det(MᵀM) = Σ (k×k minors)²`; hence `det G ≥ 0` over ℝ. — owes: S0.D4, S0.D5
- `S0.G3` `[ ]` (M) Hadamard's inequality `det A ≤ ∏ ‖row_i‖` (for the reduction bounds in Stage 2). — owes: S0.G1

---

## Stage 1 — Quadratic forms and lattices

*Goal: the objects of the theorem and the monotonicity tool the closing argument uses.*
*Library: builds entirely on Stage 0; `Integer/`, `Rational/`, `Real/`.*

- `S1.F1` `[ ]` (S) Integer-matrix symmetric form: symmetric `A ∈ Mat ℤ n n`, `Q_A(x) = xᵀAx`. Fix the integer-matrix convention. — owes: S0.M1, S0.V2
- `S1.F2` `[ ]` (M) ★ Positive-definiteness `∀ x ≠ 0, Q(x) > 0` (over ℚ/ℝ coefficients of `x`). — owes: S1.F1
- `S1.F3` `[ ]` (M) Sylvester's criterion: all leading principal minors `> 0` ⇔ positive-definite. — owes: S1.F2, S0.D5
- `S1.R1` `[ ]` (S) `Represents Q n := ∃ x ∈ ℤⁿ, Q x = n`; `Universal Q := ∀ n > 0, Represents Q n`. — owes: S1.F1
- `S1.I1` `[ ]` (M) Isometry `A ≅ B := ∃ U ∈ GLₙ(ℤ), B = UᵀAU`; equivalence relation. — owes: S0.D7
- `S1.I2` `[ ]` (M) ★ Represented-set is an isometry invariant. — owes: S1.I1, S1.R1
- `S1.I3` `[ ]` (S) `disc Q := det A` is an isometry invariant (changes by `(det U)² = 1`). — owes: S0.D4, S1.I1
- `S1.S1` `[ ]` (M) ★★ **Sublattice monotonicity:** if a sublattice's form represents `n`, so does the whole form. *(The lever for every rank-4 universality proof.)* — owes: S1.R1
- `S1.S2` `[ ]` (S) Direct sum `Q ⊕ Q'`; `Represents (Q⊕Q') n` from representations of the summands. — owes: S1.R1
- `S1.B1` `[ ]` (S) Rank-1 form `x²` represents exactly the perfect squares; its truant is `2`. — owes: S1.R1
- `S1.B2` `[ ]` (M) ★ Positive-definiteness bound: for a reduced 2×2 section, `(2a_ij)² ≤ 4·a_ii·a_jj` (Cauchy–Schwarz on the form). *(Makes each escalation step finite.)* — owes: S1.F2

---

## Stage 2 — Reduction theory and finiteness

*Goal: turn "the escalator tree" into an explicit, finite, deduplicated object.*
*Library: Stage 0–1; `Real/` ordering and suprema.*

- `S2.R1` `[ ]` (L) Minkowski/Hermite reduction: every positive-definite form is isometric to a reduced one. — owes: S1.I1, S1.F2
- `S2.R2` `[ ]` (M) Hermite's inequality: `min Q ≤ c_n · (det A)^{1/n}`; bounds diagonal entries during escalation. — owes: S2.R1, S0.G3
- `S2.R3` `[ ]` (L) ★ Finiteness: only finitely many reduced positive-definite integer forms of each bounded rank and determinant; constructive enumeration. — owes: S2.R1, S1.B2
- `S2.R4` `[ ]` (L) ★ Decidable isometry on the bounded set, via a canonical reduced representative. *(Required to collapse the tree to the exact count, not merely a finite cover.)* — owes: S2.R3, S1.I1

---

## Stage 3 — Escalation machinery

*Goal: define escalation, generate the tree, and reduce universality to the nine numbers.*
*Library: Stage 0–2; `Lists/` for the enumerated trees; `Natural/` order for the truant.*

- `S3.T1` `[ ]` (M) ★ **Decidable bounded representation:** `Represents Q n` is decidable for `n ≤ N` — positive-definiteness confines the search `Q(x) = n` to a finite box `‖x‖ ≤ √(n / λ_min)`. — owes: S1.F2, S1.R1
- `S3.T2` `[ ]` (S) Truant `truant Q :=` least `t > 0` with `¬ Represents Q t`, well-defined for non-universal `Q`. — owes: S3.T1

- `S3.E4` `[ ]` (M) The rank-3 escalators (explicit deduplicated list). — owes: S3.E2, S2.R4
- `S3.E5` `[ ]` (XL) ★★ The rank-4 escalators: machine-generate and dedup to the **≈207** isometry classes. *(Large mechanical lemma; the count is the checkpoint.)* — owes: S3.E2, S2.R4
- `S3.C1` `[ ]` (M) ★ The set of truants occurring anywhere in the tree is exactly **{1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15}**. — owes: S3.E3, S3.E4, S3.E5
- `S3.C2` `[ ]` (L) ★★ **Master reduction:** if `Q` represents the nine critical numbers then `Q` is universal — via: a non-universal `Q` would embed an escalator missing its truant ∈ {nine}. *(Depends on rank-4 universality, Stage 5.)* — owes: S3.C1, S3.E5, S5.U2

---

## Stage 4 — Ternary representation theory (deep core)

*Goal: for each ternary section used in Stage 5, prove exactly which integers it represents.*
*Library note: **p-adics are not currently in `library/`** (removed) — block **4·P** re-introduces them. The existing feeders are `IntegerMod/` (ℤ/pᵏ, and F_p at a prime), `FiniteField/`, `Polynomial/`, and `Rational/`. As of 2026-07-18 the `IntegerMod/` feeder is substantially richer than when this sheet was written: Euler–Fermat, Wilson, √−1 mod p ≡ 1 (mod 4), the F_p field instance — and `GaussianInteger/fermat_two_squares.math` (Freek #20) is proved, which is the two-squares prototype of exactly the `S4.S*` escape-hatch style.*

> **The fork that decides this stage's size.** Hasse–Minkowski gives representation
> over **ℚ** (`∃ x ∈ ℚⁿ`); the theorem needs representation over **ℤ** (`∃ x ∈ ℤⁿ`).
> Closing that gap is genus theory, whose local objects are **ℤ_p-lattices**, not
> ℚ_p-forms. Hence the three blocks below are *not* equally committed:
> - **4·P** and **4·L** (ℤ_p as a *ring*; Hilbert symbol; Hasse invariant) you need
>   **regardless** — cheap relative to ℚ_p itself, and reusable well beyond this project.
> - **4·G** (ℤ_p-*lattices*, Jordan splitting, genus/regularity) is **gated** — its
>   weight is real, so pay it only for the ternaries that genuinely force it.
>   **Defer the commit until `S3.E5` has enumerated the actual sections.**
> - **Escape hatch:** for many small ternaries the local conditions are plain
>   congruences (`n ≢ 7 mod 8`, …), provable **directly in `IntegerMod/`** with no
>   lattice apparatus. For ~20–30 named forms, finite ℤ/pᵏ arguments are often the
>   lighter path and keep p-adics confined to the single clean Hasse–Minkowski statement.

**Block 4·P — p-adic foundations (do-now; reusable)**
- `S4.P1` `[ ]` (M) Re-introduce **ℚ_p** as the p-adic-Cauchy completion of ℚ, parallel to `Real/`: field structure, p-adic absolute value, embedding ℚ ↪ ℚ_p. — owes: `Rational/` · *Mirror the `Real/` Cauchy-quotient pattern — expose a clean interface and never touch the quotient downstream.*
- `S4.P2` `[ ]` (S) ★ **ℤ_p as the valuation subring** `{x : |x|_p ≤ 1}` — a definable subring, not a second completion. Valuation `v_p`; factorization `x = p^{v(x)}·u`. — owes: S4.P1
- `S4.P3` `[ ]` (S) Unit group `ℤ_p^* = {|x|_p = 1}`; residue map `ℤ_p ↠ ℤ_p/pℤ_p ≅ F_p`. — owes: S4.P2 · *Library: identify the residue field with `IntegerMod/` at a prime / `FiniteField/`.*
- `S4.P4` `[ ]` (M) ★ **Hensel's lemma** (simple-root lift). — owes: S4.P3
- `S4.P5` `[ ]` (M) ★★ **Square classes** `ℚ_p^*/(ℚ_p^*)²`: order 4 for odd p, **order 8 for p = 2**; test squareness of a unit via Hensel (mod p for odd p, **mod 8 for p = 2**). *(The dyadic case is the cost center of the local layer — budget for it explicitly.)* — owes: S4.P4

**Block 4·L — local form theory**
- `S4.L1` `[ ]` (L) **Hilbert symbol** `(a,b)_p` and its bilinearity / explicit formulas. — owes: S4.P5
- `S4.L2` `[ ]` (L) **Hasse invariant** of a form over ℚ_p; isometry classification of p-adic forms (rank, disc, Hasse). — owes: S4.L1
- `S4.L3` `[ ]` (M) Local representation criterion over ℚ_p and ℝ (`p = ∞`): when a local form represents a given local number. — owes: S4.L2

**Block 4·G — genus / ℤ_p-lattices (gated; defer until `S3.E5`)**
- `S4.G0` `[ ]` (L) ★ **ℤ_p-lattice theory**: lattices over ℤ_p, GLₙ(ℤ_p)-isometry, **Jordan splitting** (including the dyadic `p = 2` theory). *(The real weight of 4·G; skip entirely if the escape hatch covers every section.)* — owes: S4.P3
- `S4.G1` `[ ]` (XL) ★★ **Hasse–Minkowski** (local-global) for rational representation — or a restricted version sufficient for the ternaries that occur. — owes: S4.L3
- `S4.G2` `[ ]` (L) Genus & regularity: one class per genus ⇒ local *integral* representability is global. — owes: S4.G1, S4.G0, S2.R4
- `S4.N1` `[ ]` (XL) ★★ **Three-squares theorem**: `n = x²+y²+z²` ⇔ `n ≠ 4^a(8b+7)`. Slick route = regularity of `x²+y²+z²` (uses `S4.G0/G2`); alternatives (Dirichlet-on-AP, or a Minkowski geometry-of-numbers argument) sidestep p-adics but trade in other heavy machinery. — owes: S4.G2 *(regularity route)* **or** external
- `S4.S*` `[ ]` (M each) ★ For each ternary section `T_i` from `S3.E5` (`x²+y²+2z²`, `x²+2y²+2z²`, `x²+y²+3z²`, …): its exact represented-set, via **(a)** `IntegerMod/` congruences (escape hatch), **(b)** `S4.G2` regularity, or **(c)** direct argument. *(Tag each section with the route it actually needed.)* — owes: S4.L3, plus per-section S4.G2 / `IntegerMod/`
- `S4.Q1` `[ ]` (L) *(Alternative tail route)* Tartakowsky-type bound: a positive quaternary represents all **sufficiently large** integers meeting the local conditions — reduces each rank-4 universality to a finite check. — owes: S4.L3

---

## Stage 5 — Assembly and the finite computations

*Goal: per-escalator universality and the final theorem.*
*Library: Stage 0–4; relies on the kernel's computation/reflection for the bounded checks.*

- `S5.K1` `[ ]` (L) ★ Make `S3.T1`'s bounded representation check **compute efficiently in-kernel** to the bounds needed (the "rather large calculation"). *(Performance risk — prototype before committing; verify the kernel can discharge a few thousand bounded checks.)* — owes: S3.T1
- `S5.U1` `[ ]` (M) ★ Universality template: given a rank-4 escalator `L`, a ternary section `L3 ⊆ L` with known represented-set (Stage 4), and the 4th coordinate covering the residual exceptions ⇒ `L` universal. — owes: S1.S1, S4.S*, S5.K1
- `S5.U2` `[ ]` (XL) ★★ Apply `S5.U1` across all **≈207** rank-4 escalators (mostly schematic over a shared lemma; a handful need bespoke handling). — owes: S5.U1, S3.E5
- `S5.U3` `[ ]` (M) Handle the few escalations that only resolve at **rank 5**. — owes: S5.U1, S3.E5
- `S5.F1` `[ ]` (M) ★★ **Fifteen Theorem:** combine `S3.C2` + `S5.U2` + `S5.U3`. State both forms: "represents the nine criticals ⇒ universal" and "represents 1…15 ⇒ universal." — owes: S3.C2, S5.U2, S5.U3
- `S5.F2` `[ ]` (S) *(Optional)* Minimality: {1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15} is the unique minimal forcing set. — owes: S5.F1, S3.C1

- **Shared trunk:** `S0.D*` (determinant) feeds *both* the form/isometry side and the
  Gram side — the reason Stage 0 is worth building well.
- **Two independent long poles** that can progress in parallel: the *combinatorial*
  pole (`S2 → S3.E5`, large but elementary) and the *arithmetic* pole (`S4`, deep).
  They only meet at `S5.U1`.
- **Inside the arithmetic pole, a second split:** `4·P`/`4·L` (re-introduce ℚ_p, carve
  ℤ_p, Hilbert/Hasse) are **do-now and reusable**; only the gated `4·G`
  (ℤ_p-lattices/genus) is route-dependent. The `IntegerMod/` escape hatch can satisfy
  `S4.S*` for many sections without touching `4·G` at all.
- **Earliest honest deliverable:** `S5.F1` with all `S4.*` axiomatized — finishable
  once Stages 0–3 + `S5.K1`/`S5.U1` schema are done, before the arithmetic pole lands.
  (Building `4·P`/`4·L` anyway is cheap and de-risks the eventual de-axiomatization.)
- **Prototype early & sequence the gate:** `S5.K1` (kernel computation) and `S3.E5`
  (the dedup/count) first — if either is intractable, it reshapes the whole plan.
  Then enumerate the `S4.S*` sections out of `S3.E5` and **tag each by route**
  (`IntegerMod/` congruence vs. forced regularity) *before* committing to `4·G`.
